The page is fully responsive for screens with a width of 350px and more.

Media-breakpoints: 350px, 576px, 768px, 992px, 1410px and more.

All transitions and hover-effects are performed with a 600ms delay.

Fonts are placed in a separate file "_fonts".

JavaScript code placed in separate modules.

For implementation of the project, was used Parcel-Bundler.
